What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a repository in git. This will tell git to track the files 
	in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is a temporary area where you can place the file/s ready to be 
	added to the repository. It will add granularity to the commit process. It will 
	help commit individual files separately.
